# Evolution Strategies to improve Transfer of Knowledge

#### MSc Data Science Dissertation papers list

The objective of this repository is to keep track of the list of papers that I am interested on reading as I think they could help me on my MSc Data Sciene's dissertation.

Apart from the list of papers to read, I will try keeping track of the one I am currently reading and the progress.

The dissertation goal consist on improving the task of transfer learning by using evolving strategies. As a reference paper, we currently are using [Evolved Policy Gradients](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04821.pdf).

**Dissertation supervisor:** Michael Garcia Ortiz
